Description:

You are given two strings, str1 and str2. Your task is to determine whether it is possible to transform str1 into str2 using the following operations:

You can capitalize any number (including zero) of lowercase letters in str1.

• You can delete all the remaining lowercase letters in str1.

If it is possible to make str1 equal to str2 by applying these

operations, you should output "YES"; otherwise, output "NO".

Input Format:

The first line contains a single string, str1. The second line contains a single string, str2.

Constraints:

1s str1l, Istr2 ≤ 1000

String str1 consists only of uppercase and lowercase English letters,

ascii[A-Za-z].

String str2 consists only of uppercase English letters, ascii[A-Z].

Output Format:

For each query, print YES on a new line if it's possible to make string stri equal to string str2. Otherwise, print NO. Example:

Given strl = "daBcd" and str2= "ABC", in string str1, we can capitalize

'a' and 'c' and delete 'd' to match string str2. So the output is YES. If str1= "AbcDE" and str2="AFDE", matching is not possible because letters may only be capitalized or discarded, not changed. So the
